# `crfl`: cloud reflection

NOTE: This repository is README-only.

## What is `crfl`?

`crfl` is a simple relay tool that allows you to build connection between clients behind NATs and/or firewalls.

## Features

### Connection

`crfl` clients need a server to help build connection:

```bash
crfls -p 3862  # listen on port 3862; this is the port by default
```

Suppose an http server is listening on 80 on machine A, and machine B wants to transfer from `:8080` on B to `:80` on A.
On machine A you run

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -p 3862 -f 80  # x.x.x.x is server ip
```

On machine B you run

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -p 3862 -l 8080
```

`crfl` supports `tcp/udp`. With `-t` and `-u` flag on client side, you can restrict traffic to TCP or UDP only.

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -f 80 -t  # listen tcp packs only
```

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -l 8080 -u  # transfer udp packs only
```

The two `crflc`s above will not establish any connections since they specify different protocols.

### Multiple clients

Each `crfls` holds a network that transfers data between `crflc`s. By default there can be multiple `crflc` connecting
to one `crfls`, but there can only be one `crflc` listening on the network. In this case all datapacks received from
other `crflc`s will be transferred to the listening `crflc`.

You can allow multiple listening clients on `crfls` by running

```bash
crfls -n 10  # this allows 10 listening clients at most
```

In this case when running

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -l 7000
```

`crflc` will listen on a range of ports: `7000-7009` to match each potential listening client on the network.

You can also specify the port for each listening client separately by running

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -l 7000,7010,7020,8000
```

In this case `crflc` gives `7000` to the first listening client, `7010` to the second, `7020` to the third, and
`8000-8006` to the rest.

### Specifying listening port

Sometimes connection breaks, and when the listening client is reconnected, it may be given a different port on the
network, causing some existing work to unmatch. In this case, you can specify the port to be listened on by running

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -f 80 -i 4  # 0-based
```

In this case `crflc` listens on the fifth port specified on each normal client. For example,

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -l 7000,7010,7020,8000
```

Transfers `:8001` to the above listening client.

### `crfl` over TLS

By specifying certificates on server side

```bash
crfls -s example.com/fullchain.pem:example.com/privkey.prm,www.example.com.crt:www.example.com.key  # cert1:key1[;cert2:key2[...]]
```

`crfls` will now transfer any data over TLS using these certificates. Note that you also need to use domain rather than
IP address on `crflc`

```bash
crflc -s example.com -l 7000
```

### `crfl` with password

Simply specify `-e passwd` in `crflc` and `crfls`.

```bash
crfls -e passwd
```

### working as a TUN device

`crfl` can map a listening client to a local TUN device.

```bash
crfls -t -n 256
```

You need to specify a virtual IP for each listening client, or just specify an IP range.

```bash
crflc -s x.x.x.x -l 192.168.1.0/24
```
